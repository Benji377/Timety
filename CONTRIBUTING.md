## 🛠️ Contribution Process

### 1. 🔍 Find or Open an Issue
- Browse open [Issues](https://github.com/Benji377/Timety/issues) to find something you'd like to work on.
- If it doesn’t exist yet, feel free to [open one](https://github.com/Benji377/Timety/issues/new).

> **Tip:** Want to contribute but not sure where to start? Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

### 2. 🚧 Open a Draft PR Early
We strongly recommend creating a **draft pull request** as soon as you start working. This helps:
- Avoid duplicate efforts
- Start conversations early
- Show progress and get early feedback

If possible, **link your PR to the corresponding issue** by including `Closes #<issue-number>` or `Related to #<issue-number>` in your PR description.

### 3. 🧼 Follow PR Guidelines
- Use a **descriptive title** that summarizes the purpose of the PR
- Fill out the **pull request template** thoroughly
- Keep PRs focused: one fix/feature per pull request
- If it’s a bigger change, consider opening a discussion first!

## 🔍 Code Style & Best Practices

We aim for clean, readable, and maintainable code.

- Follow Flutter’s [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) style guide.
- Keep your code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- Comment your code if it’s not immediately obvious
- Test your code and make sure `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` pass before submitting

> We’ll eventually add automatic formatting/linting rules — until then, use your best judgment and existing code as reference.

## 🧪 Testing

While we’re still building up a proper testing strategy, **unit tests and widget tests are highly appreciated**.

If you’re contributing new features or fixing bugs, consider adding tests that prove your changes work.
