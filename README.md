## Introduction
Timety is a small time tracking app with a couple more features than your ususal clock. For once, the app has a calendar, a tasks list with reminders and a pomodoro timer to track your focus. But additionally, the app also has a leveling system with achievements and titles to flex on your unproductive friends!
All this for free, offline and open-source. No data is collected and everything is stored on your device for maximum security and privacy, you are in control!
